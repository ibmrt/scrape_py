# Game Scraper 0.1
This repository contains our [*Steamist* Hackathon](https://joinstemist.org/hacks) project, called Game Scraper 0.1. This program made in python is designed to search a variety of game websites and to search for the best prices for a selected game. 

> Note: This Game Comparer Program currently compares only 2 websites (Steam and Gog), due to the timeframe and limited resources these are the only 2 we could have done.

## [Download](https://github.com/ibmrt/scrape_py/blob/master/uniScrape.exe) / Installation
 - To download, simply click on uniScrape.exe in the GitHub Repository and download the raw file. For better help, please look at our submission video. 
 - This application was tested for windows only, so we can only guarantee that this application works for Windows.

## Installation
 - After downloading the exe file, locate the file, uniScrape.exe, in your computer's file explorer, and simply just click it twice to run it.
 - You do not need to run it as adminstrator and there should only be one file to run.
 - **PLEASE** refer to the video, if you get stuck with the download or installation process.

> **DISCLAIMER**: When trying to run the uniScrape.exe file, windows might prompt you with the virus flag. Rest assured that this exe file does not contain any viruses and the flag is solely based on how the application works. The application utlizes web crawlers, which extracts data from websites something that windows doesn't like, therefore it flags it as unsafe. However, do proceed at your own risk as we are not responible with anything that happens to your computer after running the application.
